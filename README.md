# C3Projects--BreakProject
I will be creating a post-wedding website for guests of the bride and groom to post notes and pictures for the couple to view. The bride and groom will have administrative rights to view all posts, while guests will only be able to view what they, themselves have posted/uploaded.

## Project Deliverables
### Wave 1
- Create a home page with a dashboard and nav bar
- Sign in with Instagram or website login
- include ability to upload photo files or notes to a love thread viewable only by those with administrative rights. guests will only see the posts they have posted themselves

### Wave 2
- limit user accessability to photos/albums/etc based on login rights
- add ability to create a new album
- create a fake "honeyfund" page where guests can (not) contribute to the couple's honeymoon trip - displays running total and allows guests to enter amount they'd like to contribute

### Wave 3
- allow guests the option to have their notes/photos be public or private
